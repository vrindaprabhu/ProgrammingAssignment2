# The script contains two functions:
# 
# makeCacheMatrix`: This function creates a special "matrix" object
# that can cache its inverse.
# 
# `cacheSolve`: This function computes the inverse of the special
# "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
# already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
# `cacheSolve` retrieves the inverse from the cache.


# The first function, `makeCacheMatrix` creates a special "matrix", which is
# really a list containing a function to
# 
# 1.  set the value of the matrix
# 2.  get the value of the matrix
# 3.  set the value of the inverse of the matrix
# 4.  get the value of the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


# The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix"
# created with the above function. It first checks to see if the
# inverse has already been calculated. If so, it `get`s the inverse from the
# cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of
# the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the `setinverse`
# function.


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
}
